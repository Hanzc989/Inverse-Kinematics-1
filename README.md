# Inverse-Kinematics
The program generates joint angles required to move a planar n-link robot so that the robot's hand follows a specified trajectory while maintaining physical limitations in terms of maximum allowable joint velocity. 

The program takes in two files, "arm" and "trajectory" which contain the speciÂ¯cations for the robot arm and the desired end-effector trajectory for the robot respectively.
